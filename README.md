Hi All<br />

Please see DATA/SFPRICEV/index3.html as a demo of voronoi map. <br />
To generate new map, run SFHousePrice/src/MapCreating/build.py. It will generate three files: index3.html, autovoronoi.json and data.json <br />
You need to modify index3.html manually to change the connection of those three files to relative location. <br />
I haven't got time to write a readme. Check this site next week to see read me.<br />

Cheers,<br />
